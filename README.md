- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @defnetanyer. I am a second year honours mathematical physics student from University of Waterloo. I have been coding since grade 10 
and I code in python and C++.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analysis or research assistant positions. I like working on projects where I can improve my coding skills as well as see the
product of my work, such as plotting graphs etc.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mySQL and plotting in python (currently following a tutorial on how the gravitational waves were detected using python and 
utilizing scipy).
